# Workflow list definition
# This list describes the order that the Jobs execute. The "main" job is always 
# executed first, followed in order of the Jobs listed in this Workflow block
workflow:
  # "second_job" is the name of the Job that runs after "main"
  - second_job

# Shared definition block
# This is where you would define any attributes that all your jobs will 
# inherit. In our example, we state that all our Jobs will use the same Docker
# container for building in.
shared:
  # Docker image to use as the desired build container. This typically takes the
  # form of "repo_name". Alternatively, you can define the image as 
  # "repo_name:tag_label".

  image: buildpack-deps

# Job definition block
# "main" is a default job that all pipelines have
jobs:
  # Jobs are defined by name.
  # All pipelines have "main" implicitly defined. The definitions in your 
  # screwdriver.yaml file will override the implied defaults.
  main:
    # Steps is the list of commands to execute.
    steps:

      # Each step takes the form "step_name: command_to_run".
      # The "step_name" is a convient label to reference it by. The 
      # "command_to_run" is the single command that is executed during this 
      # step.
      - hello: echo Hello World
  # We define another Job called "second_job". In this Job, we intend on running
  # a different set of commands.
  second_job: 
    steps:
      # The "make_target" step calls a Makefile target to perform some set of
      # actions. This is incredibly useful when you need to perform a multi-line
      # command.
      - make_target: make greetings
      # The "run_arbitrary_script" executes a script. This is an alternative to
      # a Makefile target where you want to run a series of commands related to
      # this step
      - run_arbitrary_script: ./my_script.sh
